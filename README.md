<strong>User Story:</strong> I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

<strong>User Story:</strong> If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

<strong>User Story:</strong> When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
